#### __•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?__ ####
Separating the code into functions is vital. That makes the code easier to read and reusable. In the Python Module, I created distinct functions for each portion of CRUD. With minor modifications, this code can be used in any application using MongoDB. In addition, the functions make it easier to read and perform unit tests, ensuring that the program behaves as intended.

#### __•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?__ ####
As a computer scientist, you must thoroughly read the required specifications and then be methodical in development. With both the database and the dashboard, I worked on one piece at a time until I was satisfied with the output. Using the dashboard to demonstrate, I verified that I could connect to the password-protected Mongo database and instantiate a new class before I proceeded. I then confirmed that the data table I created had the correct number of records with the appropriate fields. This approach continued through project completion.

#### __•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?__ ####
Computer scientists solve problems and make technology more user-friendly. Grazioso Salvare had a CSV file containing 1,000 records. While the file contained all the information needed, it was not easy to find a candidate for a particular kind of rescue training. Importing the file into MongoDB made querying the information possible but required users to be fluent in Mongo. The final dashboard made it so any user could navigate the application and find a suitable candidate.
